# Apache-Spark-End-To-End-Data-Engineering
## PySpark Data Engineering Project

### Overview
This project showcases the development of multiple ETL pipelines using Apache Spark's Python API, PySpark, in a Databricks environment. The following sections detail the skills and techniques I applied and refined throughout the project.

### Key Learnings

- **PySpark Mastery**: Enhanced hands-on skills with PySpark for robust data manipulation and processing in real-world scenarios.
- **Data Handling**: Acquired the ability to integrate and process diverse data formats including CSV, Parquet, and Delta Tables, essential for modern data pipelines.
- **Design Patterns**: Implemented the Factory Design Pattern to construct reader classes, improving the scalability and flexibility of the ETL processes.
- **Business Logic Implementation**: Utilized PySparkâ€™s DataFrame API and Spark SQL to develop complex business transformation logic, tailoring data to meet analytical needs.
- **Data Storage Solutions**: Developed competence in loading processed data into modern data storage solutions like Data Lakes and Data LakeHouses.
- **Advanced Data Engineering Techniques**: Gained proficiency in:
  - **Broadcast Joins and Partitioning**: Optimized data joins and improved query performance using partitioning and bucketing strategies.
  - **Window Functions**: Leveraged Spark SQL window functions like LAG and LEAD to perform advanced data transformations.
  - **Delta Lake Operations**: Employed Delta Tables to ensure robust, transactional data integrity within Spark applications.
  - **SparkSession Utilization**: Deepened understanding of SparkSession's role in configuring and managing Spark applications.

### Project Application
The techniques and concepts learned have been directly applied to solve complex data engineering problems and prepare for technical interviews, demonstrating practical PySpark applications and discussing high-demand skills such as handling large-scale data transformations and optimizations.

### Conclusion
This project not only advanced my technical skills in data engineering but also prepared me comprehensively for future challenges in data-intensive applications and roles. It serves as a substantial example of applying theoretical knowledge in a practical, impactful manner in the field of Big Data.
