# Apache-Spark-End-To-End-Data-Engineering
## Apple Data Analytics

This repository is part of a comprehensive data engineering project executed on Databricks, leveraging Apache Spark to manage and analyze Apple-related data. The project includes several Jupyter notebooks designed using the factory design pattern, each tailored to handle different aspects of the data processing lifecycle, from extraction to transformation and loading.

### Project Structure
The project is structured into several notebooks, each serving a specific function within the data engineering workflow:

- **AppleAnalysis.ipynb**
  - **Purpose**: Conduct in-depth analytics on data related to Apple's market performance and product metrics.
  - **Features**: Includes advanced data visualization and statistical analysis to derive insights into Apple's business dynamics.

- **extractor.ipynb**
  - **Purpose**: Extract data from various sources, setting the stage for in-depth data processing.
  - **Features**: Utilizes a factory design pattern to handle diverse data formats and sources dynamically.

- **loader.ipynb**
  - **Purpose**: Load and organize the processed data in an accessible manner for further analysis.
  - **Features**: Uses a factory pattern to provide flexible loading strategies based on the type of data or source.

- **loader_factory.ipynb**
  - **Purpose**: Enhance the flexibility of the loading mechanism with a modular approach.
  - **Features**: Offers adaptable loading options through factory methods, facilitating custom implementations as needed.

- **reader_factory.ipynb**
  - **Purpose**: Read data efficiently from storage, preparing it for analysis or operational use.
  - **Features**: Implements factory methods to accommodate various storage formats and data retrieval needs.

- **Transformer.ipynb**
  - **Purpose**: Transform raw data into a standardized format that is optimal for analysis.
  - **Features**: Focuses on data cleaning, normalization, and preparation, crucial for accurate analytical outputs.

### Usage
This project is designed to run on Databricks.
